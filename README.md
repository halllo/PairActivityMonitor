visualize pair activity with two keyboards and two mouses
=========================================================
Pair programming is believed to increase code quality. But the biggest and most common pitfall according to the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/) is that both programmers don't equally engage with a task throughout the pairing session.
Even though we know this, it is easy to lose track of time and for example forget to switch roles in order to keep a balance during pairing.

This little utility can help you. It associates system wide mouse and keyboard activity to both programmers and shows a big green field when both are equally active and an increasingly reddish field as one is over or under engaging. The utility requires a dedicated mouse and keyboard for each pairing participant. 
It is very easily confirgured and provides a nice visualization of your pairing session.
